## Problem

Acme Corporation, a well-known international IT company, is developing a Java application to manage their human resources. Employees in the company belong to any of these three departments: management, engineering or administration, and may have different types of contracts: temporary, training or indefinite. The annual salary of each employee is calculated based on his/her department, type of contract and the number of years in the company.

The goal of this activity is to:

+ A) Implement the *Employee* class and its three child classes (*ManagementEmployee*, *EngineeringEmployee* and *AdministrationEmployee*), with all the necessary attributes and methods. 
* B) Write a *Staff* class, which first creates an array with all the employees in the company, and then prints the complete staff list on the screen. This class must also calculate and print the total salary for each of the three departments.
